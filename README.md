# Data Modeling (Winter Semester 2025/26)

Welcome! This repository goes along with the **Data Modeling** course at TH Köln in the winter semester 2025/26. Other resources like slides can be found on [Moodle](https://elearning.iws.th-koeln.de/moodle/course/view.php?id=2818). If you have recommendations for software tools, learning resources etc. that you would like to share with others, please add them here: [irgroup-classrooms/awesome-data-modeling](https://github.com/irgroup-classrooms/awesome-data-modeling).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) is fun, but I do not recommend it if you want to learn programming! However, I encourage you to use large language models (LLMs) to implement your ideas! In case you are pair-programming with an LLM, document the process by following these steps:
> 1. **Always try to solve the problem on your own!** Document your implementation and problems.
> 2. Ask the LLM for a solution or code review.
> 3. Document the exact model, your prompt, and the output.
> 4. Review your implementation by comparing it to the LLM output. What is the key difference?
> 5. Add the Markdown-formatted documentation to your code repository, e.g., in an additional Markdown file called `genai.md` in the corresponding `labs/` sub-directory.
